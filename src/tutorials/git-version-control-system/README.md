*[VCS]: Version Control System

> Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

## What is Git?
Git is a Version Control System (VCS). It makes it possible to jump back to any version of a file (hence the name) and helps developers to keep track of the big WH questions like:
- What changed?
- When did it change?
- Who changed it?
- Why did it change?

## Why do I need Git?
You will need to make yourself familiar working with it. Since almost all projects use some form of VCS and Git is the most used of all right now.

This is not without reason. Imagine yourself developing a simple website. Maybe you decide mid way you want to make a big layout change. How do you approach this problem? Do you just comment out all old code? Do you back it up inside a different folder? This may work for some time but what if it's the third, fourth, fifth time? This can become quite messy.

Development will also most probably take you more then one day to complete. Do you still know why you did this small change yesterday or a week later?

And now think of a bigger project with multiple developers working together over a longer period. Where do you keep your files? How do you organise changes without overwriting each others work?

Git and VCS in general is a solution of problems developers faced.
