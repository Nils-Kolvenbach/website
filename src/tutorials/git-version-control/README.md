## What is Git?
Git is a distributed Version Control System (VCS) or Source-Control Management (SCM) software, that makes it possible to track changes and jump back to any previous version of a file.

## Why should I use / learn Git?
Let's say you are an designer, creating beautiful, digital posterart. Or you are an author writing books and articles. Or an developer writing code that drives business. Then you most probably mess up at some time in the process. Wouldn't it be nice to have the ability to jump back to a previous version and even work on multiple versions at the same time?

Also think about working together with multiple people around the world. How do you manage your work without accidentally overwriting someone elses, while working on the same files? Version Control Systems are designed to be a solution to these problems and Git is one of the most used ones today.[^trend] And if you are a developer, chances are that you do not come around learning it at all.
