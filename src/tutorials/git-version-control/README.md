## What is Git?
Git is a distributed Version Control System (VCS) or Source-Control Management (SCM) software, that makes it possible to track changes and jump back to any previous version of a file.

## Why should I use Git?
Let's say you are a designer, creating beautifull, digital posterart or a developer writing code over the period of days, months and maybe even years. Then you most probably mess up at some time in the process. Wouldn't it be nice to have the ability to jump back in time to a previous version?

Also think about working together with multiple people around the world. How do you manage your work without accidentally overwriting someone elses, while working on the same files? Git and VCS's in general provide solutions to these problems. It helps you answering questions like:
- What changed?
- When did it change?
- Who changed it?
- Why did it change?
